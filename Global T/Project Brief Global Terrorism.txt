Project Brief: Global Terrorism Analysis

Situation:
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) contains detailed records of over 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide from 1970 to 2017 (excluding 1993). Governments, security agencies, and policymakers rely on data-driven insights to understand terrorism trends, assess threats, and allocate resources effectively. As a Data Analyst, your task is to analyze this dataset to uncover patterns, identify high-risk regions, and evaluate attack methodologies.

Assignment:
Using SQL, you will extract, transform, and analyze the GTD to answer key security-related questions. Your analysis should provide actionable insights for counterterrorism efforts, risk assessment, and policy recommendations.

Objectives:
Trend Analysis

	Identify the yearly trend in terrorist attacks (1970â€“2017).

	Determine if terrorism has increased or decreased over time.

	Compare attack frequency before and after major global events (e.g., 9/11, the Iraq War).

Geographical Hotspots

	Rank countries and regions by the number of attacks and fatalities.

	Identify cities with the highest attack rates.

	Analyze whether terrorism is concentrated in specific areas or spreading.

Attack Methods & Targets

	Determine the most common attack types (bombings, armed assaults, kidnappings, etc.).

	Identify the most frequent targets (civilians, government, military, religious institutions, etc.).

	Assess which attack methods cause the highest casualties.

Terrorist Group Analysis

	List the most active terrorist groups by attack count.

	Track the lethality (fatalities per attack) of major groups.

	Examine whether certain groups specialize in specific attack types.

Success Rate & Impact

	Calculate the success rate of terrorist attacks (success vs. failed/attempted).

	Analyze correlations between attack success and factors like region, weapon type, or group.

	Evaluate the economic and human cost (casualties, injuries, property damage).

Expected Deliverables:
A SQL script with queries to extract relevant insights.

A summary report (can be a README or PDF) explaining key findings.

Visualizations (if using SQL with BI tools like Tableau/Power BI) showing trends, maps, and attack distributions.
