	Average Order Value: $102,641.41
	Unique Customers: 40,013

MO - Insights

The extremely high average-order-value suggests this is a B2B or enterprise driven market. Low customer count relative to revenue indicated purchases are large-scale and not individual consumer driven. If year-over-year growth is positive, this could signal strong institutional demand. If customer count is increasing, the market may be expanding into new sectors. If AOV is rising, buyers are purchasing higher-tier products.

BPA - Insights

Revenue is tightly contested. A slight push in marketing or distribution could shift rankings. All 3 brands are above market average which suggests they have a strong brand equity and sell high-end industrial products. Nokia has the highest price but not the highest revenue indicating it has a lower sales volume and should optimize pricing for higher market share.
